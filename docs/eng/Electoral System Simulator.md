# Overview

Electoral systems are a central aspect of all facets of public life, from the lowest levels of
representation to elections with hundreds of millions of votes cast and hundreds of seats
apportioned

Over the past few centuries a multitude of electoral systems has been devised to better represent
one aspect or another of representation, favoring one party over another or one demographic over
others

With this in mind the purpose of this project is to develop a tool enabling the analysis of the
impact different voting systems can have on the result of an election

In order to lower the barrier of entry to the use of the tool I'm developing it is necessary to
limit the amount of code the end user would need to write to a minimum, in order to do this I
analyzed different real electoral systems in order to find patterns and differences.

## Example systems

In this repository have been implemented: the following systems:
+ European electoral system
+ Italian electoral system (Rosatellum)
+ Italian electoral system (Matarellum)
+ Chilean binomial system (applied on italian votes)
